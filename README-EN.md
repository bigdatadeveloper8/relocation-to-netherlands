Congratulations 🎉 If you are reading this document, you probably received a job offer with the possibility of moving to the Netherlands and took the first step. At first, I will try to answer some of the basic questions that may come to the mind of most friends. In the following, I will go into details according to the schedule and the steps you must go through.

> 🤩 **Note**
>
> You don't need to write anything down. At the end of this page, there is a [complete table](#attached-all-steps-in-a-table) to do things step by step.


# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. I heard that a large part of the monthly salary in the Netherlands has to be paid to the government in the form of taxes. In this case, what fraction of the salary will I receive at the end of the month?**

In the Netherlands, everyone who earns any kind of income is required to pay taxes. The percentage of tax paid is calculated based on your income and is not the same for everyone. People who receive lower salaries also pay a lower percentage of taxes. This tax in the Netherlands is used for public expenses, which increases the quality of public transportation and other things. You have a gross salary, which is the amount of salary that is calculated before tax deduction and is directly mentioned in your contract. Also, net salary will be the amount you receive after tax deduction. Calculating net salary can be complicated. You can use [thetax.nl] (https://thetax.nl/) website for quick and easy calculation. You can also apply 30% Tax Ruling on this site.

**2. What is Tax Ruling and how can I use it?**

This law is for people who come to the Netherlands for the first time with the highly skilled work immigration program. This law allows you to be exempted from paying a significant part of the tax for a period of 5 years. The minimum income to benefit from this law is 39,467 euros per year, excluding tax-free allowance. It also includes other benefits such as certificate conversion without the need for any tests or fees. For more information, you can refer to [page](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/coming-to-work-in-the-netherlands-30-percent-facility) do.

**3. I am planning to emigrate with my wife/partner. Can my spouse/partner also benefit from this law if he/she works?**

Unfortunately, this law only includes the case of the main person who immigrates using the highly skilled program. Although your spouse/partner cannot be exempted from paying part of his taxes under this law, he can use some privileges, such as converting his driver's license without paying a fee.

**4. How much currency can I take with me from Iran?**

According to Iran's laws, each person can withdraw currency up to 5000 euros.

If you take a risk and take more than this amount with you, note that the sum of all the money you bring with you (dollars, euros, etc.) when entering the European Union is more than [10 thousand euros] (https:// www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/abroad_and_customs/restricted_prohibited_import_export/10_000_or_more/filing_a_declaration) per person. If it was more, you are required to report. Don't be afraid to report! By the way, it is a good thing! After crossing the first European border (you can enter through Germany for example), there is a red customs line. You go there, you say I have more than 10 thousand euros, [they give a form](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/abroad_and_customs/restricted_prohibited_import_export/10_000_or_more/where_file_declaration_money) You fill it, that's it. Up to 30-40 thousand euros, usually there are not so many questions and answers. At the same time, I immigrated and, for example, Iran's banking system does not allow remittance and I don't have a credit card, etc., that's enough. If you want to take a million euros, it is not forbidden! But naturally, they will ask you to answer more questions, so that you can somehow show where the origin of this money is and that it is not black money from terrorism, drugs, etc. Note that if you have, for example, 9,900 euros and, for example, 50 dollars and two million tomans, the sum of these is over ten thousand euros! Do not risk! One of the advantages of reporting is that if you take the same to the bank, if the bank says something, you show the same sheet, [no more words] (https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/ffw/form/display. do?%24context=358E9BA5B83CBB21EFD2)!

**5. How much gold can I take with me from Iran?**

According to Iran's laws, each person can take up to 100 grams of consumable gold out of Iran. This means that it is not possible to withdraw gold coins and bars.

**6. Can I take cryptocurrency with me?**

Yes, for this you need a [Nobitex] (https://nobitex.ir/) account, to be able to deposit a lot of money, you need to authenticate. When you arrive in the Netherlands, you can open [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) and [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/) accounts (you need authentication) and then the following steps Go through:

1. Deposit money to Nobitex and buy Monero currency
2. Transfer Monero to KuCoin
3. Convert Monero to LiteCoin on the KuCoin site
4. Transfer LiteCoin to Gemini and withdraw from it to the bank account

# First part: Translation of documents

The first step is to translate the documents. The company or the Dutch Immigration Agency (IND) may ask you for additional documents, but the minimum required documents that you must translate are as follows:

-   Birth certificate
- Marriage certificate (if you are married) or a document that proves that you and the person accompanying you are partners (unfortunately, I don't know the required document :( if you know, add it).
-   Certificate
- University education certificates (not necessary)

See official translations. Be sure to ask Dar al-Tarjemeh that the translation has the stamp of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

> ⚠️ **Attention**
>
> You should take your birth certificate, certificate and marriage certificate along with their official translation to the embassy and ask for their legalization there. For more information, refer to [Part Three: Obtaining a Visa]

Depending on the university where you studied, you may need to register and receive confirmation from [Samane Sajjad website] (https://portal.saorg.ir/). The duration of translation and approval by the Ministry of Justice and Foreign Affairs varies depending on the time, but in 1400 it took one to two weeks.

# Second part: Applying for a work permit by the Dutch Immigration Office (IND)

At this stage, the company will receive your documents and send them to the immigration office along with a number of legal forms including your information such as having a bad history and certain diseases, as well as copies of identification documents, including birth certificates, passports, national cards, and if there is a marriage or partnership certificate. he does. The response time at this stage can vary depending on the time and amount of requests, but in 1401 this time was one month.

Make sure that your passport must have a signature. You can do this signature yourself on the first page in the written place. Your signature must match your signature on other documents you send and sign for the IND.


> ⚠️ **Attention**
>
> - Be sure to choose the time to meet with the IND at this stage to receive your residence card in the Netherlands. For more information, refer to the section [Receiving Residence Card] (#5-Receive-Residence-Card).
> - Be sure to choose a time to meet with the municipality to register your address and receive your BSN in the Netherlands, if possible. For more information, refer to [Register address in municipality and receive BSN] (#6-Register-address-in-municipality-and-receive-bsn).

Soldier tip: If you are a soldier and your passport has a short validity period, it is better to renew it before your trip. For this, it is enough to apply for leaving the country and go to a +10 police with the following documents and apply for a new passport. This article [how to apply] (https://virgool.io/@sadeghii0511/%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DA%A9%D8 %B4%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-am7suvn6usyn) has explained leaving the country.
- Birth certificate and national card
- The request to leave the country is approved
- Current passport
  
Personally, I filed a pilgrimage request (Alki) to renew my passport because I needed to renew it for the time of the embassy. If you register a pilgrimage request after renewing your passport during the travel period, go to the military service and declare that you did not travel and get your money back.

# The third part: Obtaining a visa

congratulation! If you have reached this stage, it means that you have received a work permit from the Dutch Immigration Office. Now, to get a visa, you should (only) make an appointment at the Netherlands Embassy in Tehran (https://www.vfsvisaonline.com/Netherlands-Global-Online-Appointment_Zone2/AppScheduling/AppWelcome.aspx?P=itfjUBdSE44q%2BnOPqZhld%2FqUJKKtoDf2% 2BrAuCfMkyc4%3D). If you are more than one person, you should make an appointment for each person. To schedule an appointment at the embassy, you can visit the embassy's website and request an appointment for an mvv visa. In many cases, the site may have problems and it is not possible to register an application, so you can send an email to the email address [teh@minbuza.nl](mailto:teh@minbuza.nl), attach the contract and the IND answer. And send your request to schedule an appointment. The queue at the embassy can vary depending on the time and volume of requests, but in June 1401, it was possible to book an appointment with the embassy through the website for the next 2.5 months. If you have a compelling reason, you can request an urgent appointment via email.

When visiting the embassy, take all your documents with you. These documents include passport, birth certificate, national card, marriage/partnership certificate, certificate, new photo according to [laws](https://www.government.nl/topics/identification-documents/documents/leaflets/2015/01/21 /photomatrix-guidelines-2007) and MVV issue and work contract. Also, make sure that you have to legalize your translated documents at the embassy on the same day. To legalize **each** document, you must bring 25 euros in cash. It is not possible to accept the amount in Rials or by bank card.

The duration of visa issuance from the time of delivery of documents to the embassy may change depending on the time, but in June 1401, this time was between one and two working days. You can also Legalize the documents along with the visa sticker at the time of passport delivery.

After receiving the visa, you will have 90 days to enter the Netherlands. If you miss the set period, you have to repeat the process again.

# Fourth part: Preparing to fly to the Netherlands

According to the terms of the contract with your company, you can reject part or parts of the following items.

## 1. Temporary residence

At this stage, you need to rent a place temporarily so that you have enough time to find a suitable house for rent. If the relocation package does not include finding a house, I suggest you don't waste your time to find a house in Iran. Considering the market conditions and the problem of housing shortage, the probability of finding a house in Iran is very low. Instead of this opportunity for PUse temporary housing at a reasonable cost.

The cost of temporary accommodation can be very expensive. For example, renting a regular house for a period of up to 10,000 euros per month was also available in The Hague in August 2022. Usually, the cost of energy (including water, electricity, gas) and internet is the responsibility of the renter of the temporary residence, but this issue can be different depending on the conditions provided. The earlier and in advance (at least a month) you reserve your temporary residence, your cost will be much lower and your chances for better options will be much higher. In the Netherlands, generally around August and before the Christmas holidays, people go to another city or country for fun, which increases the cost and reduces your chances of finding a temporary place to live. So it is better to set your migration time in advance so that it does not coincide with the holiday time.

In choosing a place of temporary residence, if the company is located in one of the four big cities (Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Utrecht) or enclosed cities between these four big cities, according to the appropriate public transportation system in the Netherlands, it is better to visit the entire enclosed area. Consider these four big cities. Of course, it is better that the place of temporary residence is closer to the city where the company is located and the city where you would like to look for a home because the cost of transportation can be significant even by using public transportation.

1. c. Booking cheap hotels

To book a cheap hotel, you can search the keywords IBIS or Budget hotels on Google and check the cost of a month's stay directly from Google. The price of these hotels in July 2022 started from 69 euros per night, which is equivalent to 2070 euros for one month. Consider that your meal in these hotels is with you and in some of them only breakfast is served for free. If you want to order hot meals from a restaurant, on average each meal will cost you between 10 and 15 euros, which is very expensive compared to the food you can cook yourself.

To book these hotels, you can use the [booking] (http://booking.com) site, which requires a foreign bank card, or seek help from intermediary companies such as Iranicart or Sharif Visa. It is also possible to book some of these hotels from Alibaba.

The YourCampus app is in [Perks and Benefits](https://www.notion.so/Benefits-Perks-839ee4012f6c4ab69be82ae58d56bc3e) DataShef.


Below is a list of suitable options for getting a temporary place to live:

- IBIS hotels or budget hotels: these hotels are cheap hotels that you can use for temporary stay. In July 2022, the price of these hotels started from 69 euros per night, but this amount may change depending on the time and conditions.
- The site [housinganywhere.com] (https://housinganywhere.com/): This site allows house owners in different countries to rent their houses through this site for temporary rent. The cost of a studio house (a small house of 20 to 40 meters that has no bedroom and the kitchen, sleeping and living area is in the main room) in July 2022 in The Hague (Den Haag) started from 2800 euros per month.
- [AirBnB] site (https://airbnb.com/): This site is also similar to the previous site, with the difference that in addition to the possibility of renting a house, there is also the possibility of renting a room, the cost of which is much lower. Renting a house on AirBnB starts from 2,800 euros per month and there are also up to 10,000 euros per month. But if you search a lot, it is possible to find a house up to the price of 1500 euros (it is better to search one to two months before entering the Netherlands). Renting a room can be possible at a lower cost, but you should note that in this situation you only have a private room and the toilet and bathroom are shared. Kitchen and living spaces, if any, are shared with other rooms, which may not be suitable.

## 2. Buying plane tickets

After booking and registering your temporary accommodation, you can buy tickets. Currently (August 2022) there is no direct flight from Iran to the Netherlands. To fly to the Netherlands, you can use one of the Turkish, Qatar or Emirates airlines. Please note that according to the geographic location of the airlines' franchise countries and a stopover in the airline's country, the length of your flight may vary from approximately 8 hours (Turkey) to 12 hours (UAE). The sooner you purchase your ticket, the more you can benefit from an airline with a shorter flight.

The amount of carryable baggage can vary from 0 kg to 40 kg depending on the ticket, flight time and airline. Also, the allowed weight for luggage does not mean that you can divide it into any number of bags. You should also consider the number of allowed luggage when buying a ticket. You can use two sites [www.alibaba.ir](http://www.alibaba.ir/) and [www.flytoday.ir](http://www.flytoday.ir/) to find tickets.

If your luggage does not have extra volume, but its weight is still lower than the allowed weight, you can use vacuum bags to reduce the volume of clothes. For example [this link] (https://www.digikala.com/product/dkp-693730/%DA%A9%DB%8C%D8%B3%D9%87-%D9%88%DA%A9%DB %8C%D9%88%D9%85-%DA%A9%D8%AF-5-%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B2-80x60-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B1/) Check in Digikala.

The best time for the distance between two flights is 2 hours. If you choose a shorter time, you may miss the flight. Also, if the distance between two flights is long, you may need a transit country visa.

There may be multiple flight times in one day. It is better for the flight to arrive at the airport before 5:00 PM. In this case, you have enough time for transportation and, if necessary, a small purchase or a dinner.

## 3. Arriving at temporary/permanent accommodation

Most likely, your airport in the Netherlands is Schiphol Airport (Amsterdam Airport Schiphol). After boarding the plane, you can immediately connect to the airport internet. Airport internet is free and does not require creating an account or entering flight information.

By following the signs, you can reach the check passport section. The Netherlands is one of the countries where almost all its residents can speak English well, so all the employees at the airport can speak English. The Czech passport officer may ask you questions about the length of stay, which you can answer according to your contract.

After the passport check section, you will reach the luggage collection section. If your luggage or luggage did not arrive and you did not manage to find it, be sure to inform the relevant official before leaving the airport.

To reach the final destination, you must consider one of the following methods:

- Coordination with the company
- Use of trains and trams: In the Netherlands, trains are used for suburban routes and trams or buses are used for inner-city routes. You can travel from almost anywhere with one of these vehicles. To use these devices, you must either buy a ticket (which costs more) or use an ov-chipkaart (which costs less). I will explain later about the ov-chipkaart, which is the transport card in the Netherlands. Also, by using the 9292 application that is in the list of applications, you can calculate the exact cost of traveling with these cards from the airport to your final destination.
- Using taxi and Uber: You can use DataChef benefits to use Uber.

## 4. Military service

If you have not joined the military yet, you must use the educational exemption to apply for permission to leave the country. You can request withdrawal from [here](https://virgool.io/@sadeghii0511/%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DA% See A9%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-am7suvn6usyn).

If you have an academic exemption and you are in one year of graduation (the course is over), you can get permission to leave the country without the university's approval. For this it is necessary:

- You have completed your graduation and completed all the university system work.
- Receive the exemption cancellation letter from the university and go to the military service in person (the best time to go is 8 am).
- After a few days, he received an SMS with the title of exemption cancellation, which you can also check through the website.

After collecting and completing the above steps, you can register and receive your request to leave your country without university approval. You can apply for an exit permit for the Netherlands without any worries. Although currently (2023) there is no clear law on this matter, there were friends who left the country without any problems with this request.

If you are still worried about this, you can apply for an exit for Turkey. If you are asked to go to Turkey, you can answer that you intend to travel to Turkey (I was asked where you are going, I answered Turkey).
To reach Turkey, take two tickets, one from Iran to Turkey and one from Turkey to Amsterdam (find two tickets on the same day with a suitable distance of 4-5 hours). You can also get a return ticket [for caution](https://www.indietraveller.co/travelling-on-one-way-tickets/).

# Fifth part: Life in the Netherlands

## 1. Finding a permanent home

In fact, this step should be done in parallel with the other steps after arriving in the Netherlands. Currently (2022), the Netherlands is facing a severe housing crisis. This shortage of houses has made finding a suitable house in the Netherlands a very difficult process and the competition for renting a house is very high. In May 2022, a furnished house with a reasonable price in a neighborhood close to the city center (the city center is usually considered a good area, because they have the best access to amenities and entertainment facilities, including cafes, restaurants, and arcades) had more than 40 applicants. To find a house in the Netherlands, you can proceed in two ways as follows:

- Real estates (makelaar) that provide expat location services in exchange for a month's rent and find a house for you. Please note that according to Dutch law, real estate agents only have the right to have a service contract with one party, that is, either with the tenant or with the landlord.
- Using public websites such as [funda] (https://www.funda.nl/) or the real estate website itself, which lists some of theThey come:
     - [pararius] (http://pararius.com/)
     - [070wonen.nl] (https://070wonen.nl/en/)
     - [www.wooncompany.nl](https://www.wooncompany.nl/en/home)
     - [riemersmarealestate](https://www.riemersmarealestate.nl/)
     - [vanpaaschen](https://www.vanpaaschen.nl/)
     - [onlyexpats.nl](https://www.onlyexpats.nl/)

After a property is suitable for you, you should make an appointment to visit the house with the realtor of that house. To set up an appointment, you can call, email or use the forms on the sites. After visiting the house, if you still want to rent the house, send an email with the address of the house to the desired property and the requested documents and clearly state that you want to rent the house. Note that the initial verbal and email request means your definite request to rent the house, and if the owner of the house chooses you from among the candidates, the house is yours. So, if you are not sure about a property, do not send an interest request.

The usual documents required for renting a house are as follows (the documents can be more or less according to the landlord's request):

- The work statement sheet that your company is obliged to provide to you.
- One-year permanent or temporary work contract
- Receipt of three months salary, if any
- An SOP that includes a description of you and your family (if any) and your conditions and offer for renting the house.
- Scan the passport of yourself and family members

Houses in the Netherlands are rented in two ways: fully furnished, normal and empty (shell). The house is fully furnished and includes all the necessary items for living, even kitchen utensils. Normal houses include a kitchen cabinet with gas, hood, dishwasher, refrigerator, and in some cases with a washing machine and dryer. Normal houses, which are mostly rented in this format, may or may not have floors (parquet, ceramic or any other type). Vacant houses, which are rare, are rented without any equipment.

In terms of energy supply and services, including the cost of gas, water, electricity, TV cable subscription and internet, houses are rented in two ways, including utilities and excluding utilities. Due to the significant increase in energy costs in 2022, the number of houses with services has decreased drastically.

It is common that in big cities you must have a monthly gross salary equal to 3 to 4 times the rent amount, otherwise you will not be eligible and your application will be rejected. Also, a deposit equal to one to three months of rental price will be taken from you as a guarantee at the beginning of the contract. The rent payment is due at the beginning of each month.

If you like a house, you can offer a deposit up to three times the rent to compete with other candidates (if three times is not mentioned in the ad itself).

When choosing a house, it is important to pay attention to the energy label of the house. Houses with a lower c energy label may cost you a lot in the winter. It is also important to choose a safe and good neighborhood. To determine whether the neighborhood is suitable or not, you can first get help from [hoodmaps.com] (https://hoodmaps.com/the-hague-neighborhood-map), which shows the quality of neighborhoods on the map. In the next step, it is better to personally go to the place at the end of the day and check the neighborhood closely. Statistically, keep in mind that the crime rate in the four largest Dutch cities is higher than in the smaller cities, and the smaller cities have a higher percentage of Dutch than immigrants.

### 1.1 House contracts

After buying a house, you need to get utility and energy contracts. If the cost of energy is not with the owner of the house, you should apply for the energy and water contract yourself. To choose energy depending on the type of home heating system, you can buy energy from electricity, gas and district heating options. Also, in choosing the energy provider company, be careful that the desired company covers your area. You can compare pricing and features [here](https://www.independer.nl).

For home internet, you have to sign a contract with one of the internet providers. It is usually better to choose the company from which you received your SIM card (most companies give a special discount in this case). For more information, refer to the section [Buying a SIM card with a Dutch number] (#2-Buying-a-SIM-card-with-a-Dutch-number).

## 2. Buying a SIM card with a Dutch number

SIM cards in the Netherlands are offered in two forms: credit (pre-paid) and permanent (postpaid). The main operators in the Netherlands are T-Mobile, KPN and Vodafone. There are other operators who provide services on the telecommunication platform of these three operators. Lebara company is one of the operators that provide service on the KPN platform and its prepaid subscriptions are very economical. As an example, the 15-euro plan includes unlimited calls within the Netherlands, 5 gigs of 4G internet and 1000 text messages within the Netherlands for a period of one month.

You can apply in person to get this SIM card and you don't need any documents. Actually, according to my experience (at vodafone), you may need to pay with a bank card. It is better to have someone who has a card with you or take your card.

## 3. Get a public transport card

Public transportation in the Netherlands includes intercity trains,The tram goes into the city and the bus. The Dutch public transport fleet is very clean and efficient, so that you can easily move from one place to another in the Netherlands. To use public transportation, you must purchase a ticket using one of the following methods:

- Buying a one-time ticket that has a higher cost.
- Preparation of Private OV-Chipkaart, which has a lower cost and does not belong to a specific person.
- Preparation of Personal OV-Chipkaart, which has a lower cost than the previous two methods and belongs only to you and no one else is allowed to use it.

You can also purchase a ticket or check your OV-Chipkaart charge and travel history through Application NS. Also, if you buy a subscription through the NS application, you can benefit from a 40% discount for weekend trips and off-peak times.

After you come from the airport, you can buy this card at the central station in Amsterdam and downstairs (ask for directions). Its cost is 7 euros, and it's good to put an extra 20 euros in it until you get a bank card that can be recharged easily.

After you get the Netherlands number, register on the [ns] site (https://www.ns.nl/en) and by giving an address (it doesn't have to be in your name) you can get your own personal card that has more features. It is like automatic charging.

## 4. opening a bank account

Since electronic payments are very common in the Netherlands and cash payments are rarely made, having a bank account is necessary for everyday needs in addition to receiving a salary. To open a bank account in the Netherlands, having a BSN is required. Since receiving a BSN is a time-consuming process, some banks in the Netherlands have the possibility to open an account on the condition that the BSN is provided within 90 days.

### 4.1 Revolut account
<div dir="rtl">
Revolut is a Lithuanian financial institution that allows you to get an IBAN (something like an IBAN number/card number with which you can receive money) without having a BSN, provided that you provide up to 90 days online and without the need to visit in person as soon as possible. provides possible To get started, install the Revolut app on your phone. Then open an account by entering your information.
</div>

There are several ways to authenticate, but I think the most convenient for us are these two:

1. Passport
2. Visa

  Within 24 hours, your information will be confirmed and your account will be activated. As soon as your account is activated, you can pay or receive money. Also, after the account is approved, you can add your card to Apple Wallet for contactless payment (Pose device) in stores.

# Attachment 3: Military

I am writing the way that I know to leave the country when I was in the army and I saw that I did the rest. This way is for those who have educational exemption and their exemption has not yet ended.

After you plan your departure time according to the steps [in this post](https://farzaad.com/blog/%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%86-%D9% BE%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%BE%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA-%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%A7% Go ahead and get your passport (if you need it) and exit permit.

You may be worried about whether you can leave the country with a work visa or not. I do not know the answer to this and there is no official answer anywhere. There are people who came directly to the Netherlands with this visa and no one had anything to do. If you have a particular concern (for example, your university may ask why you are going to the Netherlands or when you leave the country), you can select Turkey as your destination and buy two tickets, one from Iran to Turkey and one from Iran to the Netherlands. In this way, you can not bring a name from the Netherlands when you leave.

The next point is about passport renewal. According to international laws, the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands will renew your passport even if you have not joined the military.
